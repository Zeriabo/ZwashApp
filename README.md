TODO:

Payment processing: You may want to implement a payment processing system that allows customers to pay for the car wash service. This could involve integrating a payment gateway or payment API to your system, and creating payment-related models and controllers.

Booking and scheduling: You may want to allow customers to book a specific time slot for their car wash service, and track the scheduled services using a calendar or scheduling system. This could involve implementing booking-related models and controllers, as well as creating a user interface for customers to select and book a service.

Inventory management: If your car wash service involves selling products like car cleaning agents, air fresheners, or other car accessories, you may need to keep track of your inventory levels and manage your stock. This could involve creating inventory-related models and controllers, as well as implementing a user interface for managing your inventory.

Reporting and analytics: To understand how your car wash business is performing, you may want to track key performance indicators like the number of services provided, revenue generated, and customer satisfaction levels. This could involve creating reporting-related models and controllers, and implementing a dashboard or analytics system to visualize the data.

Staff management: If you have employees working at your car wash business, you may need to manage their schedules, track their performance, and handle their payroll. This could involve implementing staff-related models and controllers, as well as creating a user interface for managing your employees.
