Introduction
Zwash is a car washing app designed to simplify the process of booking car washing services. It provides a set of RESTful APIs to manage car, booking, user, and car washing program-related operations.

Installation
To use the Zwash app and interact with its APIs, you need to follow these installation steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/zeriabo/zwash.git
Open the project in your preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

Build the project to download the required dependencies.

Usage
Once you have completed the installation steps, you can start using the Zwash app. To access and interact with the APIs, we will be using Swagger UI.

Start the application by running the main method in the ZwashApplication class.

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html to access the Swagger UI.

In the Swagger UI, you will see a list of available endpoints categorized by controllers. Explore the available endpoints to understand the functionality of the Zwash app.

To interact with the APIs, click on an endpoint and provide the required parameters. You can also try out the endpoints by clicking the "Try it out" button and observing the responses.

When making requests, make sure to include the necessary JSON payload in the request body. If using the Jackson library, ensure that you include the @class attribute in the JSON payload for proper serialization and deserialization.

Endpoints
Here are the main controllers and their associated endpoints:

Car Controller: Manages car-related operations.
Booking Controller: Handles booking-related operations.
User Controller: Manages user-related operations.
Car Washing Program Controller: Deals with car washing program-related operations.
Please refer to the Swagger UI for detailed documentation on each endpoint.
